"""Retention policy implementations for KV-cache retention directives.

Policies compute per-turn retention_directives that instruct the inference
server to protect specific token ranges in its KV-cache with explicit
priorities and TTLs. The directives are injected into the request via
the extra_body mechanism in ChatCompletionAPIData.

    """DAG-aware retention (KVFlow, arXiv 2507.07400).

    The trace-replay datagen supplies a per-producer reuse-depth profile: a
    list of segments over the producer's prompt token range [start, end), each
    with:

      - breadth: how many later calls reuse up to `end`. Higher breadth ->
        higher priority tier (high/mid/low).
      - cold_gap: longest run of intervening calls the region goes untouched
        between consecutive reuses. TTL = cold_gap * per_span_s + queue_margin_s
        + ttl_buffer_s, so a recency-hot region (cold_gap ~= 0) gets only the
        margins and is not over-retained.

    No profile (output never reused) -> no directive (immediate LRU evict).
